# Gmail Headers Retrieval
 Retrieves Gmail Headers and sort it according to sender address or domain name.


This application retrieves your Gmail headers and sorts the sender address/domain according to the frequency of it appearing in your Gmail.

This will let you know what address/domain is the most frequent sender to your Gmail address, and you can decide to act accordingly.

To use this, put your username and application specific password and click on the Connect button.

You can get your application specific password for your Gmail by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/) and click on App Passwords, and choose Other (custom name).

Note that the name in the Sender field is the first one encountered for the email address, and thus if you have multiple names from the same email address, the name will not be updated.

Enjoy using this app!
